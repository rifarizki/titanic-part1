# Titanic Survival Prediction Pt. 1

*Hi, there!* ðŸš¢

As you might have familiar with the Titanic Competition in Kaggle , I also decided to join the challenge and do some prediction of whether a passenger will survived or not based on several parameters. Since this is a classification problem, I am using two algorithms and would later compare the performance result from both models. Here are the algorithms that I'd be using in this repo:

* logistic regression âœ…
* k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) âœ…

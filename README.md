# Titanic Survival Prediction Pt. 1

**Hi, there!** ðŸš¢

As you might have familiar with the Titanic Competition in Kaggle , I also decided to join the challenge and do some prediction of whether a passenger will survived or not based on several parameters. I am using two classification algorithms and would later compare the performance result from both models. Here are the algorithms that I'd be using in this repo:

* logistic regression âœ…
* k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) âœ…

The Titanic Survival Prediction will be divided into two parts and this is the first part of the prediction *(Part 2 will be uploaded soon!)*
